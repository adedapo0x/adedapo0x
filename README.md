## About Me
Greetings! I'm Adeyemi Al-Hameen Adedapo, a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development. My passion for this field comes from a constant desire to learn and solve complex problems. I love getting my hands dirty while trying to build efficient and secure systems that tackle real-world challenges and I do enjoy using tools I learn to solve problems that I conceive. 


* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript, Node.js, Express
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting better at solving problems using DSA
- Fun fact: I do wish I was good at basketball and chess, who knows? maybe it's not too late for me
