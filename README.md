## About Me
Greetings! I'm Adeyemi Al-Hameen Adedapo, a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development. My passion for this field comes from a constant desire to learn and solve complex problems. I love getting my hands dirty while trying to build efficient and secure systems that tackle real-world challenges and I do enjoy using tools I learn to solve problems that I conceive.
